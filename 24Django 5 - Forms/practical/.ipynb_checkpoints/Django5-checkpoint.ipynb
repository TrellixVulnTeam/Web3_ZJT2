    "Something missing so far from our blog web application is a convenient way to add and edit blog posts. So far you have been using Django's generic admin tool which is not customized to your specific application. With Django forms we will be able to design a customized interface for our application to add and edit data to our database. We can either define one from scratch or create a `ModelForm` which will save the result of the form to the model. We will do the later since it's easier. So let’s begin by creating a form for our Post model. Forms have their own file `forms.py`. Hence we need to create a file with this name in the blog application directory."

The `created_date` field should be filled automatically when a post is created. In the next steps we will use the form in a view and display it through a template.

There is a huge amount of functionality already prebuilt that you can take advantage of.
