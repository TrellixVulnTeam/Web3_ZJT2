    "# node.js 4 - Express Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look for the definition of `framework` in the dictionary you will find that it is often defined as an essential supporting structure of a building, vehicle, or object.  In software, it's essentially the same thing. A software framework is a supporting structure that allows you to build on top of it. When it comes to web development, and we want to build large APIs, or maybe HTTP servers, we can leverage web frameworks to make our life easier. There many options in the `node.js` ecosystem intended for web development but the most popular one is [Express](http://expressjs.com/).\n",
