This will be used to match against the paths specified in the incoming HTTP request. In this example, in the first call of the `url` function, we're using ^$, so we're matching against the empty string or a visit to the domain with nothing after it (http://yourdomain.com/).\n",

In this example, if someone goes to `http://yourdomain.com/` with nothing else in the URL (no file path), Django will call the `post_list` view. Lastly, the `urlpatterns` takes a name parameter at the end. This is what we used previously in our template to refer to a specific URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure that Django uses when responding to HTTP requests is to look at `urlpatterns` and begin a scanning at the top to determine if the first element in `urlpatterns` matches the incoming HTTP request path. If there's a match, it will call the associated view, otherwise it will continue into the next pattern. In this case, if the URL is `/post/1/` then Django will go to the `post_detail` view, otherwise, it will go to the next pattern if one would exist.\n",

The `\\d` also tells us that it can only be a digit, not a letter (so anything between 0 and 9 will be valid). + means that there needs to be one or more digits in place. So something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/post// is not valid, but http://127.0.0.1:8000/post/1234567890/ is perfectly ok!\n",
