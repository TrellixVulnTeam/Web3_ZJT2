    "- threads: start a new thread to handle each request. pros: easy, and kinder to the kernel than using fork, since threads usually have much less overhead, cons: your machine may not have threads, and threaded programming can get very complicated very fast, with worries about controlling access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second basis thesis is that one thread-per-connection is memory-expensive. Compare for instance a graph showing memory consumption between Apache server ( which uses a single thread for every connection) and Nginx which doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/ApacheVSnginx.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache is multithreaded: it spawns a thread per request (or process, it depends on the conf). You can see how that overhead eats up memory as the number of concurrent connections increases and more threads are needed to serve multiple simulataneous clients. Nginx and Node.js are not multithreaded, because threads and processes carry a heavy memory cost. They are single-threaded, but event-based. This eliminates the overhead created by thousands of threads/processes by handling many connections in a single thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way of making code run in parallel within a single thread. However, all I/O is evented and asynchronous in node.js by using separate threads for I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having synchronous execution is good, because it simplifies writing code (compared to threads, where concurrency issues have a tendency to result in WTFs).\n",
    "In node.js, you aren't supposed to worry about what happens in the backend: just use callbacks when you are doing I/O; and you are guaranteed that your code is never interrupted and that doing I/O will not block other requests without having to incur the costs of thread/process per request (e.g. memory overhead in Apache).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having asynchronous I/O is good, because I/O is more expensive than most code and we should be doing something better than just waiting for I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "An event loop is \"an entity that handles and processes external events and converts them into callback invocations\". So I/O calls are the points at which Node.js can switch from one request to another. At an I/O call, your code saves the callback and returns control to the node.js runtime environment. The callback will be called later when the data actually is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/node.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, on the backend, there are threads and processes for DB access and process execution. However, these are not explicitly exposed to your code, so you don't need to worry about them other than by knowing that I/O interactions e.g. with the database, or with other processes will be asynchronous from the perspective of each request since the results from those threads are returned via the event loop to your code. Compared to the Apache model, there are a lot less threads and thread overhead, since threads aren't needed for each connection; just when you absolutely positively must have something else running in parallel and even then the management is handled by Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than I/O calls, Node.js expects that all requests return quickly; e.g. CPU-intensive work should be split off to another process with which you can interact as with events, or by using an abstraction like WebWorkers. This (obviously) means that you can't parallelize your code without another thread in the background with which you interact via events. Basically, all objects which emit events (e.g. are instances of EventEmitter) support asynchronous evented interaction and you can interact with blocking code in this manner e.g. using files, sockets or child processes all of which are EventEmitters in Node.js."

When the user inputs a file name followed by pressing the enter key, your program should emit a 'read_file' event. An emitter instance of the EventEmitter class should bind the 'read_file' event to a callback function that tries to read the file using the module `fs`. This callback function should use the emitter instance to emit events depending on whether there was an error reading the file ( for instance if the file does not exist) or whether there was success in reading the file. Finally, you should ensure that the program exits gracefully using the appropriate object. An illustration of the program's behavior  is provided below, the file `input.txt` exists in the folder were the application is run. The file `aaa.txt` does not exist:\n",
